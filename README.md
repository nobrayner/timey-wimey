Timey Wimey is a simple time-logging app to help keep track of daily work in a job where time tracking must be done for _everything_.

_image and demo TBA_

## Project Goals

* To decrease the mental load required when tracking time spent during the work day
* To make easy collation of time spent and descriptions for re-logging in other systems

## What I Learned

* Sometimes the best solution is the simplest solution; I tried being fancy, and that net me a total restart!
* TBD
